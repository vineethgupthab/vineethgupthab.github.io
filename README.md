Welcome to my personal website repository! This repository hosts the code and assets for my personal website.

## Overview

A Data Scientist with 4 years of experience in solving business and research problems by applying Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing algorithms. Currently pursuing a Masters in Data Science at the University of San Francisco.

## Work Experience

Data Scientist Nov 2022 – June 2023 Reputation.com Hyderabad, India
● Location Alias
- Developed a pipeline with the Fellegi-Sunter probabilistic model for clustering business listings across digital directories and sub-clustering child businesses.
- Facilitated simultaneous updates across the top 8 search directories for improved online presence for the business.
● Google Feature Recommendation
- Built a customized feature recommendation system with ensemble machine learning algorithms, achieving 92% accuracy in
Google Maps ranking predictions.
- Designed a data selection strategy, elevating overall performance to 97% accuracy and facilitating data-driven feature
enhancements for a competitive edge.
● Navigation on the product platform using LLM
- Ideated and developed POC to help users navigate on the platform with general text queries to enhance the user experience by
using large language models.
● Request review response
- Implemented an automated Google review response system using pattern recognition from existing review text and integrated
standard business suggestions into the BERT classifier for sentiment analysis and response recommendations using ML models.
- The system has accelerated the rate of customer support responses by 30%.

Senior Research Engineer June 2021 – Nov 2023 Wipro AI Labs Bangalore, India
● Helios
- Developed a real-time hate tweet identification system with geographic insights by using NLP algorithms such as LSTM to detect tweets with hate content.
- Collaborated with teams from UT Austin, IIT-Patna, and IIT Delhi on the project to enhance hate speech detection efficiency and accuracy through an active learning approach.
● FACTDEMIC (Fake Claim Detection and Meta-Fact Checking Through Textual Entailment-based Validation)
- Designed and developed a 4-stage web application that utilizes machine learning models and BERT textual entailment to validate and detect fake news on social media automatically. The application uses open-source data mining to provide supporting evidence
and follows conceptual rules.
● Antharyami (A smart keyboard for code-mixed language models)
- Researched the poor performance of code-mixed language models and proposed and implemented a data ingestion strategy to enhance the overall efficiency of the language model.
- Implemented techniques, including a beam search algorithm from scratch, to enhance word predictions in statistical language models.

## Achievements and Research Publications

● Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC 2020)
- [“Minority Positive Sampling for Switching Points - an Anecdote for Code-Mixing Language Modelling”](https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.764/)
-- Code-Mixing (CM) or language mixing is a social norm in multilingual societies. CM is quite prevalent in social media conversations in multilingual regions around the world. In this paper, we explore the problem of Language Modeling (LM) for code-mixed Hinglish text. To better understand the problem of LM for CM, we initially experimented with several statistical language modeling techniques and consequently experimented with contemporary neural language models including the attention models such as GPT and BERT. Our analysis suggests switching-points are the main challenge for the LMCM performance drop, therefore in this paper we introduce the idea of minority positive sampling to selectively induce more sample to achieve better performance.

● CONSTRAINT-21 Shared task collocated with AAAI 2021
